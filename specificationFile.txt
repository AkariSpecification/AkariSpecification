Test specification file
implemented by XML

describe version code
describe source code for test in Intel and OpenPower

classify file in 5 category

file1: Test specification describe file
file2: Test specification describe file + output from Intel
file3: Test specification describe file + output from OpenPower
file4: Test specification describe file + output from Intel + output from OpenPower 
file5: Test specification describe file + comparison summary+ output from Intel + output from OpenPower 

output from Intel and openpower is described afterward

Need to join specification description and test result in same file?

Comparison result is described afterward or in front? If in front, description must be reordered.

How to define floating point random number generation algorithm

define floating point random number generation algorithm by Python in specification file

define testing code defined in C language

we cannot name algorithm of test or random number generation

add infinity and NaN （Quiet NaN)and SNaN(Signaling NaN) and 0(Zero) to floating point random number generation

add minus value

need to generate decimal floating point random value

write data format of output from x86 and OpenPower

Execute Test C language code by command and pass parameter by command argument
